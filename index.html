                    <h3>A little about me</h3>
                    <p>I was born in California to a funny dad, sweet mom, and a very annoying brother. As a lot of siblings, my brother and I didnâ€™t have a very good relationship. My mom always said we would grow up and love each other. I am now 20 and barely speak to my brother. My mother is not happy about it. And that is a little bit of my life story. Hope you had fun reading!</p>
